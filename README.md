## Footy Table

Footy Table is a football league prediction and standings tracker. Users can
predict match outcomes, see actual results, and track their prediction accuracy.
The app displays fixtures in a card-based grid, allows score input, and updates
league standings in real time based on match results and user predictions.
Color-coding helps users quickly identify correct, incorrect, or missing
predictions.
